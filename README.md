# Automatic detection of Spontaneus Synaptic Activty by the use of the glutamete sensor iGlusnFr.
Author: Camila Pulido

##
> [!NOTE]
>* This protocol delineates the analysis for the detection of spontaneous activity within synaptic boutons, employing the genetically engineered Glutamate sensors iGluSnFR, published [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.08.24.554624v1)
>* This protocol is intended to use two analysis programs: [ImageJ (Fiji)](https://fiji.sc/) and [IGOR Pro (wavemetrics)](https://www.wavemetrics.com/).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> * Prior to implementing this protocol, users need to customize the provided code to align with their individual settings.
> * Maintain consistent file naming formatting across all experiments.

## Image collection and preprocessing: 

Spontaneous glutamate realease can be detected by the increase in fluorescent signal within synaptic boutons. The sample video bellow is exemplifed spontaneous activity in on synaptic bouton labbeled with an arrow.
